Description:
Developed a Calorie Management Client Application as the final project in Front-End Development, utilizing ReactJS for the user interface. The application is designed to help users track their daily calorie intake and generate detailed monthly reports.

Features:

Calorie Tracking: Users can add new calorie consumption items, specifying the number of calories, category (BREAKFAST, LUNCH, DINNER, OTHER), and a description.
Monthly Reports: Users can generate detailed reports for any specific month and year, providing insights into their calorie consumption patterns.
Technical Implementation:

Database: Implemented client-side data storage using IndexedDB, facilitated by a custom library (idb.js). This library manages database operations through asynchronous functions that return Promise objects, ensuring smooth and efficient data handling.
User Interface: The UI was developed using ReactJS, providing a responsive and dynamic user experience. The design adheres to modern web standards, ensuring usability and accessibility.
Key Responsibilities:

Developed and integrated the IndexedDB library for robust client-side data storage.
Implemented ReactJS components to create an intuitive and interactive user interface.
Ensured the application met all project requirements, including detailed monthly reporting and real-time calorie tracking.
Technologies Used:

ReactJS: For building the user interface.
IndexedDB: For client-side data storage, managed through a custom library.
JavaScript (ES6+): For asynchronous programming and overall application logic.
